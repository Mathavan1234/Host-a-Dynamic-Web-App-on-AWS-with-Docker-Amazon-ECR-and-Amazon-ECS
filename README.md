🚀 Host a Dynamic Web App on AWS with Docker, Amazon ECR, and Amazon ECS

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a dynamic web application on AWS using Docker, Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry), and Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service). The application utilizes a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) and follows best practices for security and deployment.

🔧 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

✅ An AWS account

✅ AWS CLI installed and configured

✅ Docker installed on your local machine

✅ GitHub account for code storage

✅ SSH key pair for secure access

✅ Basic knowledge of AWS services

📜 Steps to Deploy

1️⃣ Set Up SSH Keys

🔹 Create an SSH key pair to clone a private GitHub repository.🔹 Add the public key to GitHub.

2️⃣ Create a Three-Tier VPC Network

🔹 Create a VPC, Internet Gateway, and attach it to the VPC.🔹 Configure public and private subnets.🔹 Set up NAT Gateways for private subnet internet access.

3️⃣ Configure Security Groups

🔹 Create security groups with appropriate inbound and outbound rules.

4️⃣ Set Up RDS Database (MySQL)

🔹 Create subnet groups for RDS.🔹 Launch a MySQL database instance in a private subnet.

5️⃣ Clone and Push Application Code

🔹 Clone the GitHub repository locally.🔹 Push the application code to GitHub.

6️⃣ Create Docker Configuration

🔹 Write a Dockerfile for the LAMP stack.🔹 Use .gitignore to prevent sensitive information from being pushed.🔹 Implement environment variables for security.🔹 Build the Docker image.

7️⃣ Push Docker Image to Amazon ECR

🔹 Create an ECR repository.🔹 Authenticate AWS CLI for ECR access.🔹 Tag and push the Docker image to ECR.

8️⃣ Set Up Bastion Host and Migrate SQL Data

🔹 Create an EC2 instance as a Bastion Host for secure access.🔹 Use SSH tunneling to connect to the RDS instance.🔹 Install Flyway for database migrations.🔹 Execute SQL migration scripts.

9️⃣ Configure Load Balancing

🔹 Create a Target Group.🔹 Set up an Application Load Balancer (ALB).

🔟 Store Environment Variables Securely

🔹 Use an S3 bucket to store environment variables.🔹 Assign IAM roles with proper permissions to access S3.

1️⃣1️⃣ Deploy the Application on ECS Fargate

🔹 Create an ECS cluster.🔹 Define a task with CPU and memory allocation.🔹 Deploy the containerized application using ECS Fargate.

1️⃣2️⃣ Configure DNS for the Application

🔹 Create an A record in Route 53.🔹 Point it to the ALB DNS name.

🎉 Final Outcome

Your dynamic web application will be successfully deployed on AWS ECS Fargate in a serverless manner. 🚀✨
